/**
 * TokenTransferService - DEPRECATED
 *
 * Incoming token transfers are now handled by Sphere SDK's PaymentsModule.
 * The SDK automatically accepts incoming transfers via the TransportProvider
 * and updates balances. The WalletManager listens for 'transfer:incoming'
 * events to update UI (badge, notifications).
 *
 * This file is kept empty for reference.
